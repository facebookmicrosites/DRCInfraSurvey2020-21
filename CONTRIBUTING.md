It's not expected additional survey data will be added to the collection by Meta nor that any 3rd party data collected by others will be added to the collection.

The best way to help is by reporting problems with the data itself via [Issues](https://github.com/facebookmicrosites/DRC_Infra_Survey_2020-21/issues). Thanks!
