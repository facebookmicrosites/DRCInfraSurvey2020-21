# A new way to survey potential fiber routes — without access to paved roads
The data accessible via this GitHub repo was gathered using the process described in this Engineering at Meta blog post:
* [A new way to survey potential fiber routes — without access to paved roads](https://engineering.fb.com/2022/05/01/connectivity/fiber-routes/)

Included in this rich data set are the results of an Environmental Survey, a Construction Survey and a Geotechnical Survey (Gamma Spectrometer + Penetrometer) covering 5,898 km of potential fiber optic routes or other buried infrastructure.

## Requirements
* A PC with Windows, macOS or Linux
* Sufficient hard drive space (~200GB) to install QGIS software and store survey data
* The current version of QGIS Long term release (avoid Latest release)

## Installing and using QGIS
* Install the current version of QGIS Long term release (**avoid Latest release**)
